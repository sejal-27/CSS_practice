              Although we don’t know whether parallel universes exist, we know
              something else about them with certainty: many people
              instinctively dislike them, and whenever a physicist writes a book
              about them, the Web erupts with claims that they are unscientific
              nonsense. My new book “Our Mathematical Universe” proved to be no
              exception. “Is this still science?” the biologist Mark Buchanan
              wondered on the pages of New Scientist, “Or has inflationary
              cosmology veered towards something akin to religion?” The
              physicist Peter Woit dismissed it as “grandiose nonsense”. If
              you’re a multiverse skeptic, you should know that there are many
              potential weaknesses in the case for parallel universes, and I
              hope you’ll find my cataloging of these weaknesses below useful.
              To identify these weaknesses in the pro-multiverse arguments, we
              first need to review what the arguments are. Many physicists have
              explored various types of parallel universes in recent books,
              including Sean Carroll, David Deutsch, Brian Greene, Michio Kaku,
              Martin Rees, Leonard Susskind and Alexander Vilenkin.
              Interestingly, not a single one of these books (my own included)
              makes any outright claims that parallel universes exist. Instead,
              all their arguments involve what logicians know as “modus ponens”:
              that if X implies Y and X is true, then Y must also be true.
              Specifically, they argue that if some scientific theory X has
              enough experimental support for us to take it seriously, then we
              must take seriously also all its predictions Y, even if these
              predictions are themselves untestable (involving parallel
              universes, for example). As a warm-up example, let’s consider
              Einstein’s theory of General Relativity. It’s widely considered a
              scientific theory worthy of taking seriously, because it has made
              countless correct predictions - from the gravitational bending of
              light to the time dilation measured by our GPS phones. This means
              that we must also take seriously its prediction for what happens
              inside black holes, even though this is something we can never
              observe and report on in Scientific American.
