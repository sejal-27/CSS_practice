              Feeling lonely, even when you’re surrounded by people, doesn’t
              mean something is wrong with you. In fact, Dr. Leela R. Magavi,
              psychiatrist and regional medical director for Community
              Psychiatry in New Port Beach, California, says everyone feels this
              way sometimes. “I would contend that all human beings struggle
              with loneliness intermittently, whether they are aware of it or
              not,” she said. “Trauma, loss, and stress can exacerbate feelings
              of loneliness.” This is why you could still experience loneliness
              in a relationship or having a large group of friends. “Individuals
              may feel lonely when surrounded by others when they feel like they
              cannot be themselves or have to fabricate the truth to please
              others [or] when the individuals around them have different
              ethical beliefs,” Magavi explained. Other reasons you might feel
              lonely despite being surrounded by others include:
              <ul>
                <li>depression or other mental</li>
                <li>
                  health conditions health conditions, including disabilities
                  chronic conditions, and terminal illness
                </li>
                <li>loss and grief</li>
                <li>
                  trauma discrimination or racism migration to a new country
                </li>
                <li>existential crisis</li>
                <li>
                  lack of meaningful relationships communication or attachment
                  problems in a relationship
                </li>
              </ul>
              The pandemic and need to physically distance have also increased
              debilitating feelings of loneliness, says Magavi. “Extroverts may
              struggle more than introverts,” she added. “Individuals with low
              self-esteem, depression, or anxiety may have an external locus of
              control and may rely on extraneous factors to feel whole.”
