                The real reason why many people continue to struggle while
                others successfully overcome the greatest of odds comes down to
                the simple act of self-reflection. Those who struggle simply do
                not take the time to learn from their experience in order to
                make the necessary adjustments to improve their results. It’s
                really as simple as that! People who have overcome the greatest
                of odds are the ones who do a tremendous amount of
                soul-searching. This helps them to put all their experiences
                into perspective, which further allows them to make better
                choices and decisions. In other words, they take the time to
                learn from their experiences, and this helps them adjust their
                course of action moving forward. This process of learning comes
                through the act of self-reflection. Self-reflection is an
