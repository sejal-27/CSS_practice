              Feeling lonely from time to time is natural and not uncommon. If
              you feel lonely, reaching out to loved ones and practicing
              self-compassion can help you overcome loneliness. The fact that it
              is common doesn’t mean feeling lonely might not feel overwhelming
              to you. This is why, if you’re experiencing this right now, you
              may be questioning why that is and how to stop feeling lonely.
              You’re really not alone! In fact, according to a recent report by
              the Harvard Graduate School of Education, 36% of surveyed people
              reported feeling lonely “frequently” or “almost all the time or
              all the time.” Also, 61% of those between 18 and 25 years old
              noted feeling degrees of loneliness. Whether you’re feeling empty
              or lonely, this is an emotion you can overcome. Understanding why
              you feel this way is a good place to start. Regular periods of
              self-reflection effectively allow you to:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Learn from your failures, mistakes, and experiences. Clarify
                  your values, priorities, and strengths.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Release emotional attachment to people, things, and events.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make better choices, independent decisions, and new
                  associations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remove inner roadblocks that hold you back from achieving your
                  goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Examine your habitual behavior patterns and intuitive
                  feelings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Uncover hidden dreams and aspirations as well as undiscovered
                  potential.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gain deeper insights into your thoughts and a vast array of
                  experiences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Expand your perspective and understanding of people and
                  situations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Better spot potential problems and opportunities in advance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Respond calmly and appropriately to challenges that may have
                  otherwise hindered your progress.
